##2016-03-25 - Release 2.1.0
###Summary

Update the default roundcube version to 1.1.4 and add support for Puppet 4.

####Improvements

* Replace [ripienaar/module_data](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/ripienaar/module_data) with `params.pp`; the module is
  unlikly to work with Puppet 4 (see [Native Puppet 4 Data in Modules](https://www.devco.net/archives/2016/01/08/native-puppet-4-data-in-modules.php))
  and in order to not break Puppet 3 support it is easier to just stick with a simple `params.pp` for the moment.
* Set `composer_disable_git_ssl_verify` parameter to `false` by default; previously it was set to `true` for all Debian
  systems to ensure the bootstrapping of the roundcube app would work even though one of the roundcube git repositories
  was presenting a SSL certificate not matching the domain. But now the complete installer is used instead, so this flag
  is no longer required.

Furthermore, the test infrastructure has been overhauled:

* Bump gem dependencies to the latest version
* Bump Puppet module dependencies to the latest version
* Update travis test matrix and add support for Puppet 4
* Replace VirtualBox with Docker for acceptance tests
* Add Debian 8
